CLASS net/minecraft/class_287 net/minecraft/client/render/BufferBuilder
	COMMENT Builds a buffer of primitives and optionally sorts them by the distance
	COMMENT from the camera.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>This builder can sort quad primitives. It sorts them by the distance
	COMMENT between the camera position and the center of the quad. Sorting is
	COMMENT required when drawing translucent objects because they have to be drawn
	COMMENT in back-to-front order. See
	COMMENT <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Transparency_Sorting">
	COMMENT Transparency Sorting - OpenGL Wiki</a>.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>For {@link VertexFormat.DrawMode#LINES LINES} and {@link
	COMMENT VertexFormat.DrawMode#LINE_STRIP LINE_STRIP} draw modes, this builder
	COMMENT duplicates every vertex in a line to produce a quad with zero area. See
	COMMENT {@link GameRenderer#getRenderTypeLinesProgram}.
